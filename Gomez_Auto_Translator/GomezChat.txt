[4/13/2017 11:03:44 AM] Gomez: I know you just got here, but do yyou want to join us for thai?
[4/13/2017 11:09:06 AM] Gomez: I guess that is what you were talking about, lol.
[4/13/2017 11:12:19 AM] Rodger Sherman: yes indeed it is
[4/13/2017 11:23:15 AM] Gomez: so, I would end up doing something like this?
[4/13/2017 11:23:16 AM] Gomez: var gpsFileInfo = new GPSFileInfo(filePath);
         var uploadableGPSFileInfo = gpsFileInfo as Uploadable;
                        foreach(var jur in juris) {
                            uploadableGPSFileInfo.AddJurisdictionalData(jur.ID, jur.Name);
                        }
                        foreach(var c in components) {
                            uploadableGPSFileInfo.AddSubmissionData(c.ID, c.IDNumber, c.FileNumber);
                        }
         dir.EntriesToProcess.Add( new GPSFileInfo( filePath ) );
[4/13/2017 11:25:34 AM] Rodger Sherman: one - I'd double check that you have to explicitly cast it to Uploadable
[4/13/2017 11:25:58 AM] Gomez: var uploadableGPSFileInfo = gpsFileInfo as Uploadable;
[4/13/2017 11:26:08 AM] Rodger Sherman: two - even if you do need to cast it to Uploadable, then you could just write
[4/13/2017 11:26:28 AM] Rodger Sherman: ((Uploadable)gpsFileInfo).AddJurisdictionalData(...)
[4/13/2017 11:26:38 AM] Rodger Sherman: three - c.ID better be the keytbl
[4/13/2017 11:26:44 AM] Gomez: why not
[4/13/2017 11:26:50 AM] Gomez: got it, got it, got it
[4/17/2017 11:14:13 AM] Gomez: well, last night was kinda dissapointing

[4/17/2017 4:37:16 PM] Gomez: I dont want to say it beucase the next thing is ggoing to come out of your mouth is "I was right"
[4/17/2017 4:37:45 PM] Gomez: I think the guys that setup the web api messed up the setup for the fuwutil libraries
[4/17/2017 4:37:50 PM] Rodger Sherman: lololol
[4/17/2017 4:37:55 PM] Rodger Sherman: say it
[4/17/2017 4:38:00 PM] Gomez: no!
[4/17/2017 4:38:02 PM] Rodger Sherman: I already know I'm usually right
[4/17/2017 4:38:08 PM] Gomez: fuck you
[4/17/2017 4:38:43 PM] Gomez: so anyways, this chick, from last night. she left a lot to desire, plus she is not the cutest out there, but I was kinda upset
[4/17/2017 4:38:52 PM] Rodger Sherman: why were you upset
[4/17/2017 4:41:00 PM] Gomez: well, she kinda did a bad job in bed, she came like 4 times, and she could barely made me cum once. I was like wtf... and now you are leaving... of course this was after like 2 hours, lol
[4/17/2017 4:41:23 PM] Rodger Sherman: I can't think of a lamer reason to be upset
[4/17/2017 4:42:40 PM] Gomez: are you kidding me! I think if she comes that many times at least I should get half of them, or what are the fucking rules about this game?
[4/17/2017 4:42:43 PM] Gomez: lol
[4/17/2017 4:42:59 PM] Rodger Sherman: uhhhh it's physically impossible for men to cum at the same rate women can/do
[4/17/2017 4:43:34 PM] Gomez: there have been women that have been able to do that. that asian Chick, damn it we need to go to texas, lol.
[4/17/2017 4:43:42 PM] Rodger Sherman: I said at the same rate
[4/17/2017 4:43:52 PM] Rodger Sherman: I do not believe for one second you could come 25+ times in an hour
[4/17/2017 4:44:03 PM] Gomez: lol
[4/17/2017 4:44:19 PM] Gomez: no, but 2-4 in 2 hours yeah
[4/17/2017 4:44:34 PM] Rodger Sherman: still, your expectations are unreasonably high
[4/17/2017 4:44:49 PM] Rodger Sherman: where is the "I was right" moment?
[4/17/2017 4:45:18 PM] Gomez: fuck it, whatever I guess you might be right on this one, but like I said, I know for a fact is not impossible...
[4/17/2017 4:45:23 PM] Gomez: fuck you, I will not say it
[4/17/2017 4:45:43 PM] Rodger Sherman: it IS impossible to cum at teh SAME RATE as women
[4/17/2017 4:45:57 PM] Rodger Sherman: and if you disagree, well, you aren't doin it right
[4/17/2017 4:46:03 PM] Gomez: yes it is, I am not saying that. but more than once in a 2 hour period is possible
[4/17/2017 4:46:08 PM] Gomez: lol
[4/17/2017 4:46:30 PM] Rodger Sherman: lol @ 'more than once in 2 hours' when women can cum 50+ times in that same time frame
[4/17/2017 4:46:44 PM] Rodger Sherman: like, 25/hour is on hte low side
[4/17/2017 4:46:49 PM] Rodger Sherman: ANYWAYS

[4/18/2017 1:36:41 PM] Gomez: I mean is good that her status shows that, right?
[4/18/2017 1:36:43 PM] Rodger Sherman: lawl I wasn't sure I wanted a whole lot of people to know
[4/18/2017 1:36:53 PM] Gomez: you are a man you should be allowed to continue dating while she is waiting for you
[4/18/2017 1:36:58 PM] Rodger Sherman: my status alsos hows that, but my privacy is set to very limited
[4/18/2017 1:37:11 PM] Rodger Sherman: uh, no, I don't want either of us fooling around
[4/18/2017 1:37:12 PM] Gomez: oh, lol

[4/19/2017 11:05:53 AM] Gomez: why do you think I have a box of tissues everywhere in the house and at my desk. you bastard
[4/19/2017 11:06:33 AM] Rodger Sherman: for masturbating, duh
[4/19/2017 11:06:53 AM] Gomez: well, besides that. plsu masturbation I only do it in one place, your room ;)
[4/19/2017 11:07:00 AM] Gomez: and dont need tissues there

[4/19/2017 11:22:31 AM] Gomez: or whatever it isshow, demostractions, walk around place, etc.

[4/19/2017 11:25:46 AM] Rodger Sherman: Jake's comin with me to that but DJ bailed
[4/19/2017 11:25:53 AM] Rodger Sherman: and I have no one to go tot eh capitol with
[4/19/2017 11:28:11 AM] Gomez: if I did it I would go with you, but I think on that one I am going to feel really out of place as the only one not doing it. if Jake is coming with you to suicide girls I wont go then, it sounds like a great show, but hours make it a little bit difficult with the kids and find a babysitter.
[4/19/2017 11:28:27 AM] Rodger Sherman: I figured
[4/19/2017 11:29:40 AM] Gomez: tell me how it goes, maybe next time they come I ll go

[4/20/2017 9:32:10 AM] Rodger Sherman: I don't

[4/20/2017 1:30:54 PM] Rodger Sherman: heyyyy me too
[4/20/2017 1:31:28 PM] Gomez: in my sort of defense before i ran it , I check with Kale and he thought it looked good.
[4/20/2017 1:31:38 PM] Rodger Sherman: lawl
[4/20/2017 1:38:01 PM] Gomez: I know, so I have been hitting it off with this girl from OKC, I asked her out she is like sure but I only can on Mondays or Tuesday, the rest of the time I am on call.

[4/20/2017 1:39:17 PM] Gomez: but when she said that I am like I dont think she read all of my profile. so I had to tell her that I have kids, that is on my profile too. she hasnt responded yet... :(
[4/20/2017 1:40:16 PM] Rodger Sherman: well, if you said monday/tuesday wouldn't work for you, it's likely that's the end
[4/20/2017 1:41:28 PM] Gomez: well I didnt tell her that, that I could do Monday probably, but I had to tell her about the kids situation, I told you that whenever I go out on a date before that I tell them I have kids, specially if I have them as often as I have them right now, they will noticed I am not that available
[4/20/2017 1:43:57 PM] Rodger Sherman: it's on your profile
[4/20/2017 1:44:00 PM] Rodger Sherman: her fault for not reading
[4/20/2017 1:44:30 PM] Gomez: exactly. I know but still, lol.

[4/24/2017 2:09:24 PM] Gomez: I guess negating that could help you
[4/24/2017 2:12:22 PM] Rodger Sherman: ugh
[4/24/2017 2:12:23 PM] Rodger Sherman: see
[4/24/2017 2:12:28 PM] Rodger Sherman: you made the same mistake I almost did
[4/24/2017 2:12:31 PM] Rodger Sherman: you only check hte count
[4/24/2017 2:12:42 PM] Rodger Sherman: not that one is a proper subset of the other
[4/24/2017 2:36:49 PM] Rodger Sherman: also, I saw the 'having' clause and I couldn't make it work in InfoPath land
[4/24/2017 3:00:24 PM] Gomez: Oh, yeah that sucks, i guess the current logic you have will have to do it for now
[4/24/2017 3:00:57 PM] Gomez: Dude, so, Asian girl from Texas just contacted me
[4/24/2017 3:06:35 PM] Rodger Sherman: And?

[4/24/2017 8:14:29 PM] Rodger Sherman: We have to talk about NVT tomorrow

[4/24/2017 8:15:06 PM] Rodger Sherman: and then TCM will modify the content of the NVT tables appropriately if they fuck with a validation, right?
[4/24/2017 8:15:14 PM] Rodger Sherman: Well, that may not be enough

[5/2/2017 1:08:31 PM] Gomez: well, in my case they are equal, Mike hasnt worked that much on Evo and fucked up my repo, lol.
[5/2/2017 1:10:26 PM] Rodger Sherman: how did he break the repo exactly
[5/2/2017 1:10:54 PM] Gomez: well, he merged into the wrong branch, and he couldnt just reverse the commit

[5/2/2017 1:11:11 PM] Rodger Sherman: lol
[5/2/2017 1:11:19 PM] Rodger Sherman: This is why I whine about branches ;)
[5/2/2017 1:11:25 PM] Gomez: so I have to do some branch off the previous commit, merge into the new branch ignore the changes from the merge and push

[5/2/2017 1:16:13 PM] Gomez: I know, but that is how it has been done for a while, we used to have that branch and then it was decided to just kill it

[5/4/2017 10:43:51 AM] Gomez: nope, she parks on the fron sidewalk?
[5/4/2017 10:43:59 AM] Rodger Sherman: nevermind then, I didn't see her or hear her
[5/4/2017 10:44:00 AM] Gomez: I dont think thats how I am supposed to say it
[5/4/2017 10:44:18 AM] Gomez: the front house
[5/4/2017 10:44:26 AM] Rodger Sherman: I didn't think anyone would be home. no school?
[5/4/2017 10:44:27 AM] Gomez: no dude, I would never leave you with that kind of resposability

[5/4/2017 10:45:22 AM] Rodger Sherman: I didn't see anyone in the house when I left at 8 am
[5/4/2017 10:45:30 AM] Gomez: thats fine, yeah. Gicelle wakes up like 10 minutes before the kids have to go to school
[5/4/2017 10:45:32 AM] Rodger Sherman: and I normally run into them getitng ready

[5/4/2017 10:46:00 AM] Gomez: that makes sense, no, usually before i leave the house I check that Gicelle is there, if she is supposed to drop off the kids
[5/4/2017 10:46:16 AM] Rodger Sherman: and the last few times Gicelle was here she was parked in the driveway
[5/4/2017 10:46:22 AM] Gomez: meh, they are supposed to be awake by 8, I mean they should not even be at the house at 8, lo
[5/4/2017 10:46:22 AM] Rodger Sherman: I didn't even look out front
[5/4/2017 10:46:48 AM] Gomez: hah, I think she has been staying at the house when she comes to take the kids to school
[5/4/2017 10:47:10 AM] Gomez: she just parks on the front house whenver she comes over to help me with the kids
[5/4/2017 10:47:33 AM] Rodger Sherman: Dwight works for the fire department for our neighborhood
[5/4/2017 10:47:36 AM] Rodger Sherman: and he does 48 hour shifts
[5/4/2017 10:47:41 AM] Rodger Sherman: so we got breakfast at santiago's
[5/4/2017 10:48:19 AM] Gomez: but yesterday, I was closed to leave the kids by themselves. she was supposed to have been there at 4, and I saw Ethan and I thought it was her, then something told me to check for her car, when I didnt see it I was fucking pissed that she wasnt there yet
[5/4/2017 10:48:29 AM] Gomez: but that was a really close call on leaving the kids by themselves
[5/4/2017 10:48:42 AM] Gomez: thats cool. Its nice to have that santiago's so closed by
[5/4/2017 10:49:17 AM] Rodger Sherman: I got taquitos
[5/4/2017 10:50:22 AM] Gomez: cool. I usually go for tamales, or their breakfast burritos, I miss those way too much
[5/4/2017 10:50:27 AM] Gomez: and usually XX hot
[5/4/2017 10:52:04 AM] Gomez: fuck, I feel like I wasted my time, but not really I need to understand that Nick doesnt know anything about Evo and how to handle async stuff that well
[5/4/2017 11:15:19 AM] Gomez: so, just to give you a heads up, on a normal week. Gicelle is going to be at the house twice, to drop off the kids
[5/4/2017 11:16:45 AM] Rodger Sherman: that's fine

[5/4/2017 12:44:02 PM] Gomez: ok, I need to tell Gicelle to get the time off so I can go to the show, if she cant take the time off thats the show stopper for me, so pretty much Wed, Thursday and Friday, right?

[5/4/2017 12:45:10 PM] Rodger Sherman: but yes

[5/8/2017 10:49:16 AM] Rodger Sherman: these notes that will have CheckValidation are not linked to anythingi n ValRule_To_Note
[5/8/2017 10:49:24 AM] Rodger Sherman: you'd need to run a LEFT OUTER JOIN
[5/8/2017 10:49:58 AM] Rodger Sherman: as an example, Note Id 191300 is an example note
[5/8/2017 10:50:02 AM] Gomez: oh, ok. yeah my logic is not correct, I need to fix that
[5/8/2017 10:50:39 AM] Gomez: my bad, I might have missread the ticket
[5/8/2017 12:29:08 PM] Gomez: dont forget to do non billable for the HR meeting
[5/8/2017 12:29:18 PM | Edited 12:29:20 PM] Gomez: I almost did again
[5/8/2017 12:29:20 PM] Rodger Sherman: lol I just rolled that into my daily hour meeting task
[5/10/2017 9:32:01 AM] Gomez: holly fucking hell, are the peope in NJ way underpaid or just some developers in general?
[5/10/2017 9:51:46 AM] Rodger Sherman: Nj is underpaid
[5/10/2017 9:53:11 AM] Gomez: i believe you are underpaid as well, I dont know how much you make but since there is not like a huge gap between you and me I think you are going to get the same speech than me, adjust to be inside the band then your 2%
[5/10/2017 10:01:18 AM] Rodger Sherman: I'm definitely in the band
[5/10/2017 10:21:14 AM] Gomez: sushi tomorrow?

[5/10/2017 10:45:44 AM] Rodger Sherman: I thought we already covered the eVo Option stuff
[5/10/2017 10:46:11 AM] Gomez: I dont think so, tbh I feel this is the first time we have talked about it, but I tend to forget shit sometimes
[5/10/2017 10:46:23 AM] Gomez: so please educate me or re-educate me
[5/10/2017 10:46:30 AM] Rodger Sherman: uh we have most definitely discussed it multiple times
[5/10/2017 10:46:31 AM] Rodger Sherman: but it's fine
[5/10/2017 10:46:54 AM] Rodger Sherman: Staging FUW can associate uploads to "Evo"
[5/10/2017 10:46:57 AM] Rodger Sherman: on your uploadable
[5/10/2017 10:47:08 AM] Rodger Sherman: you'd write
[5/10/2017 10:48:20 AM] Rodger Sherman: myUploadable.AddOption(FUWDirTree.Option_EvoUpload)
[5/10/2017 10:48:27 AM] Rodger Sherman: if you do that before you upload it, it uploads with hte otpion
[5/10/2017 10:49:01 AM] Rodger Sherman: if you're adding it to an existing item, one that's already been uploaded, call .Save after
[5/10/2017 10:50:18 AM] Gomez: ok, I can do that, I still dont remember you telling me this before
[5/10/2017 10:50:45 AM] Rodger Sherman: it was in very nearly every meeting about GPS and EVO
[5/10/2017 10:51:05 AM] Rodger Sherman: We'd talked about how I was going to write stuff to upgrade all existing EVOUPLOADS to use hte new system
[5/10/2017 10:51:19 AM] Rodger Sherman: I even confirmed with you when Iw rote that method, but I wrote it wrong, so I have to redo it anyway
[5/10/2017 10:52:23 AM] Gomez: ok, I will make the changes, I dont think that really changes that much on the current logic that I have now
[5/10/2017 10:52:26 AM] Gomez: sorry
[5/10/2017 10:52:39 AM] Rodger Sherman: nope it should be real easy
[5/10/2017 10:52:41 AM] Rodger Sherman: which was the goal
[5/10/2017 10:52:48 AM] Rodger Sherman: and if you do that, we even gave them tehir own fancy icon
[5/10/2017 10:53:01 AM] Gomez: nice
[5/10/2017 10:53:06 AM] Gomez: I like that fancy icons
[5/10/2017 10:53:59 AM] Rodger Sherman: lol fancy here means it looks like hte ANdroid 'share' icon, rotated right 90degrees
[5/10/2017 10:54:10 AM] Gomez: lol
[5/10/2017 10:54:50 AM] Gomez: oh, good thing we are talking about money, do you have the other half of the rent, lol.

[5/26/2017 11:13:25 AM] Gomez: yeah, I am actually I pretty much told her this morning that I am lucky to have a job that lets me make up for my time, but that is not to accomodate her anymore. either she helps with the kids or we go halfies for summer camps or something

Wayne Olinger
[6/2/2017 2:37:40 PM] Wayne Olinger: it's a bit low-brow but i salute whoever named this file
[6/2/2017 2:37:43 PM] Michael Gentilello: lol
[6/2/2017 2:45:15 PM] Michael Gentilello: this is a good time to stop
[6/2/2017 2:45:15 PM] Michael Gentilello: lol
[6/2/2017 2:45:26 PM] Wayne Olinger: good work for today
[6/2/2017 2:47:52 PM] Michael Gentilello: its cause i was debugging already
[6/2/2017 2:47:53 PM] Michael Gentilello: #oops
[6/2/2017 2:47:57 PM] Michael Gentilello: in another project
[6/2/2017 2:48:00 PM] Wayne Olinger: i do that all the time
[6/2/2017 2:48:10 PM] Wayne Olinger: i wish the error message made more sense
[6/2/2017 2:48:43 PM] Michael Gentilello: well it actually gave me information if i read it lol
[6/2/2017 2:48:57 PM] Wayne Olinger: mine doesn't
[6/2/2017 2:49:05 PM] Wayne Olinger: says something like "cannot find .exe file"
[6/2/2017 2:51:49 PM] Michael Gentilello: lol
[6/2/2017 2:51:58 PM] Michael Gentilello: i just noticed that the locations were the same but for two different projects
[6/2/2017 2:52:07 PM] Michael Gentilello: and since i was debugging the one it would make sense that the file is already in use
[6/2/2017 2:54:16 PM] Wayne Olinger: right but why can't it see that there's a lock on it and not that "it canot find" it?
[6/2/2017 2:54:38 PM] Michael Gentilello: cause you didnt get good wayne
[6/2/2017 2:54:50 PM] Wayne Olinger: i didn't write that error message
[6/2/2017 2:54:55 PM] Gomez: you shuld have
[6/2/2017 2:55:05 PM] Wayne Olinger: im pretty sure it's a visual studio message
[6/2/2017 2:55:15 PM] Wayne Olinger: which means the thing probably existed before i started college
[6/2/2017 2:55:18 PM] Gomez: you are a visual studio message
[6/2/2017 2:58:35 PM] Wayne Olinger: racist
[6/2/2017 2:59:21 PM] Wayne Olinger: you brown devil
[6/2/2017 2:59:50 PM] Gomez: lawl
[6/2/2017 3:03:48 PM] Wayne Olinger: so david says that zack did get him the signing bonus they discussed before leaving, so he now feelings like it was a genuine miss-understanding
[6/2/2017 3:04:54 PM] Gomez: and he still left, lol.
[6/2/2017 3:05:11 PM] Gomez: I mean GLI didnt want to give him the raise he deserved, well him and kale
[6/2/2017 3:06:35 PM] Michael Gentilello: that sucks
[6/2/2017 3:06:39 PM] Wayne Olinger: right, david was going to be the manager under the assumption he was getting his $93k AND the bonus
[6/2/2017 3:06:46 PM] Michael Gentilello: but at the same time if it is then they should have worked to get david to stay
[6/2/2017 3:06:59 PM] Wayne Olinger: i agree
[6/2/2017 3:07:09 PM] Wayne Olinger: i think GLI is stupid for letting him go
[6/2/2017 3:07:23 PM] Michael Gentilello: like, hold onto your letter for now
[6/2/2017 3:07:25 PM] Michael Gentilello: let me see what i can do
[6/2/2017 3:07:26 PM] Wayne Olinger: and their screwing over of him has made shane and I want to leave too
[6/2/2017 3:07:28 PM] Michael Gentilello: and if i cant then you can leave
[6/2/2017 3:07:31 PM] Michael Gentilello: but ill try to get this situated
[6/2/2017 3:07:36 PM] Michael Gentilello: you know, how a manager should be lol
[6/2/2017 3:07:58 PM] Michael Gentilello: i think everyone would feel better if it didnt seem like no one cared
[6/2/2017 3:08:02 PM] Wayne Olinger: everyone keeps telling me that Zack's hands are tied
[6/2/2017 3:08:07 PM] Wayne Olinger: and yeah
[6/2/2017 3:08:11 PM] Michael Gentilello: i dont really accept that
[6/2/2017 3:08:20 PM] Wayne Olinger: someone said it's Regal being a dick or something like that
[6/2/2017 3:08:24 PM] Michael Gentilello: what?!
[6/2/2017 3:08:27 PM] Michael Gentilello: i wouldnt think of that
[6/2/2017 3:08:35 PM] Michael Gentilello: tim is a great guy
[6/2/2017 3:08:42 PM] Michael Gentilello: the first one i would immediately blame is maida
[6/2/2017 3:08:50 PM] Wayne Olinger: well my issue is everyone has seemed really nice around here
[6/2/2017 3:09:04 PM] Wayne Olinger: and yet we don't have pay bands (which i never wanted but i'd like to be within them)
[6/2/2017 3:09:07 PM] Wayne Olinger: and we don't have a decent raise
[6/2/2017 3:09:17 PM] Michael Gentilello: yeah it blows
[6/2/2017 3:09:23 PM] Michael Gentilello: work culture can only take you so far
[6/2/2017 3:09:23 PM] Wayne Olinger: when we have greivences they are kinda just ignored
[6/2/2017 3:09:33 PM] Michael Gentilello: or they misunderstand them completely
[6/2/2017 3:09:46 PM] Michael Gentilello: like a year or two ago during a survey meeting they said a top complaint was communication
[6/2/2017 3:09:54 PM] Michael Gentilello: since most of the time people dont learn stuff until its already done
[6/2/2017 3:10:08 PM] Michael Gentilello: lack of transparency and communicating whats happening in other departments
[6/2/2017 3:10:10 PM] Michael Gentilello: know what they did?
[6/2/2017 3:10:19 PM] Michael Gentilello: said they would have more interdepartmental activities like lunches
[6/2/2017 3:10:26 PM] Michael Gentilello: no you jackoffs
[6/2/2017 3:10:40 PM] Michael Gentilello: i mean, if something changes in the QA process and i am unaware of it, then it causes issues that could be easily avoided
[6/2/2017 3:10:47 PM] Michael Gentilello: same thing with engineering and compliance / qa
[6/2/2017 3:10:57 PM] Michael Gentilello: and i am 99% sure everyone else thought that way too
[6/2/2017 3:11:11 PM] Michael Gentilello: idgaf what kim from qa did this past weekend
[6/2/2017 3:11:18 PM] Michael Gentilello: i care about what kim has done to change the process of something im working on

[6/2/2017 3:15:02 PM] Wayne Olinger: really
[6/2/2017 3:15:13 PM] Wayne Olinger: the biggest reason i want to leave is cause they don't know what the fuck their doing
[6/2/2017 3:15:36 PM] Wayne Olinger: if they're not smart enough to see theirs a problem (and a decent way to fix it) then it's never going to get better
